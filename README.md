# üí´ About Me:
Hey there! <br><br><br>I'm Bhargav, a passionate Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) student currently in my 2nd year at VIT-AP University.<br>I‚Äôm deeply interested in the world of electronics and VLSI design, always curious about what makes things tick at the silicon level. I'm working toward becoming a VLSI Engineer, blending logic, precision, and creativity.<br>I‚Äôve explored and worked with several programming languages like Python, Java, C/C++, Verilog, and Assembly Language for both 8085 microprocessors and ARM microcontrollers. <br>My tools of choice include:<br>EDA Playground (for HDL simulations)<br>Keil uVision (for ARM microcontroller development)<br>GNU Simulator (for 8085 architecture)<br>One of my exciting projects is the Smart Vault Locker, which activates only with the correct fingerprint ‚Äî a practical blend of hardware and software security.<br>I also had the opportunity to attend a workshop in collaboration with Carl Zeiss, gaining real-world insights into industry practices and tech trends.<br>I consider myself a fast learner, a natural problem solver, and someone who thrives in a team leadership or coordination role. Whether it‚Äôs collaborating on tech stacks or debugging a complex system, I love turning challenges into learning opportunities.<br>Always building, always learning ‚Äî and always open to new ideas, projects, and collaborations!<br><br>
